# PHP Development environment using Docker

I copied most of the configs from [nanoninja /
docker-nginx-php-mysql](https://github.com/nanoninja/docker-nginx-php-mysql), but I am using the official php images in addition to getting xdebug working (on VS Code, Windows 11, Docker Desktop with WSL2).

I have not tested the Makefile or Travis CI yet.

You can read the [original README here](old_README.md).
